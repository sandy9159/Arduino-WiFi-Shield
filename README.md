# Description

An Arduino Shield that allows you to prototype Arduino Wifi projects. It used Pin2,3 and Pin9,10 for Software Serial (Jumper Selectable). It can external power (9VDC) or be powered by the Arduino or from an FTDI Adapter.


The Arduino WiFi shield allows an Arduino board to connect to the internet using the WiFi library and to read and write an SD card using the SD library.

The WiFi Library is included with the most recent version of the Arduino IDE. The firmware for the WiFi shield has changed in Arduino IDE 1.0.4. It is strongly recommended to install this update per these instructions

The WiFI library is similar to the Ethernet library and many of the function calls are the same.

To use the shield, mount it on top of an Arduino board (e.g. the Uno). To upload sketches to the board, connect it to your computer with a USB cable as you normally would. Once the sketch has been uploaded, you can disconnect the board from your computer and power it with an external power supply.

Digital pin 7 is used as a handshake pin between the WiFi shield and the Arduino, and should not be used.
